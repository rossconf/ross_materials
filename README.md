### Projects
ROSS conf Amsterdam gives open source software maintainers the platform to introduce their project to an audience of first time as well as existing contributors. After 15 minute introductions to the project, pressing issues and requests, the conference day is reserved for hands-on programming (or contributing through updating documentation or adding artwork!) and pairing with the maintainers. To conclude the hackathon the maintainers present data on bugs fixed, and pull requests merged.

[Exercism](http://exercism.io/)
Exercism.io is written in Ruby using the Sinatra web framework and primarily maintained by [Katrina Owen](https://github.com/kytrinyx), who is a polyglot developer and Ruby Hero award winner who accidentally became a developer while pursuing a degree in molecular biology. She cares deeply about open source and contributes to several projects outside of exercism.

[RVM](http://rvm.io/)
[Michal Papis](https://github.com/mpapis) maintains RVM since 6 years and his primary focus is releasing RVM v2 into the world, with your help!

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
Ruby package manager for macOS Homebrew will be represented by core team member [Alyssa Ross](https://github.com/alyssais).

[Traveling Ruby](http://phusion.github.io/traveling-ruby/)
